# Image Generation Project

This project harnesses the capabilities of the OpenAI API to facilitate image generation. It provides users with three distinct options to create and manipulate images:

## Options:

### 1. Creating Images from Scratch based on a Text Prompt

This feature empowers users to generate images by inputting descriptive text prompts. 

### 2. Choose Random Image Generation

For those seeking inspiration or randomness in their image creation process, this option allows you to request completely random images. The system utilizes the OpenAI API to generate images without specific prompts, resulting in a diverse range of visual content.

### 3. Creating Variations of an Existing Image

This functionality enables users to take an existing image as a base and generate multiple variations of it. Whether you want to explore different artistic styles, experiment with filters, or simply produce a series of related images, this option streamlines the process.

## Output: 10 Images

Regardless of the option you choose, the project will provide you with a set of 10 images as output.

## Technologies Used

This project leverages the following technologies:

- **Node.js:** The server-side of the application is built using Node.js. It handles the interaction with the OpenAI API and manages the backend logic.

- **React:** The front-end of the application is built using React. It provides an intuitive user interface for interacting with the image generation options.
